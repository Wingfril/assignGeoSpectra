NOTE:
------------------------
To run DataCubeManipulation.pro, you will need
- a folder named maps
- a folder named proc
- a folder named spectra
- a folder named formattedMaps
- a folder named UMaps
- a folder named UFormatted
- a folder named guideimg

IF ANY OF THESE FOLDERS ARE NAMED WRONG, SH*T WILL HIT THE FAN

Things that should be compiled

getMu0
getMuMu0
dataCubeManipulation
assignGeoCSV
matching
nearest_element
spexDriver
viewingLayers
writeMapHeader
zmo_drm_ephemeris
zmo_drm_lcm
zmo_pf_get_mu
zmo_pf_image_latlon
drm_spextool

Spextool itself only deals with prism grating type. 
Single-order Long and single-Order short are not supported


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------------------
Step 1. 

Run zmo_xgeom for every processed guide image

Step 2. 

Open up spextools

Step 3.

Update the paths to the respective directories

Step 4.

Create the Calibration files. 

    There should be 5 flats followed by an arc. If the files are
    flat.00236, flat.00237, flat.00238, flat.00239, flat.00240, 
    arc.00241, enter in 236 - 241

Step 5.

Click on Spatial Extraction and reduce a single image. 

    Under images, if 240.a and 241.b exists, type in 240-241
    For the full flat and wavecal name, find the calibrated file.
    It should be named something like flat236-240, wavecal241-241
    Now click on load Image

    When everything is load, click on Guide image and find
    the respective guide image. 

    Put the box on the slit; if the slit is too long vertically, 
    put it in the middle... 

    Exit out of the assign geometry window

    Click Suggest/Flip Extraction Region

    Click 'Go' under Make spatial profiles

    Click the large horizontal button 'Extract'

Step 6. 

Run createLayers
        
    Input the respective directories and click 'Begin'
    
    If everything goes well (fingers crossed), it will first reduce all the 
    

Step 7.

Format the layers

    Click the format button on the right hand side.
    
    You will need to fit limbs several times; it would be total number of 
    layers divided by 100, rounded up no matter what. 

    YOU *****MUST***** fit the limbs for the very first (layer 0), and the 
    layer right before sum.fits. For more accurate limb fittings, you should
    look through all the layers beforehand and figure out when the planet stops
    / starts moving (since for some odd reason the planet appears to shift...)

    Once you're done fitting the limbs, click format again. 

Step 8. 

    Run ViewingLayers again
